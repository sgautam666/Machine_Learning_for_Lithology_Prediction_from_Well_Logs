# Machine_Learning_for_Lithology_Prediction_from_Well_Logs
Using geophysical well logs to predict lithology

**Author**: [Suman Gautam](mailto:smngeo@gmail.com)

## Overview

This is an ongoing project on building a machine learning models to accurately predict lithology from the Geophysical Well logs.


## Data

The well logs are provided by XEEK.ai To get more information follow the link below:
(https://xeek.ai/challenges/force-well-logs/overview)


## Content

The introductory data exploration is provided in a separate notebook while the machine learning models are provided under each type of the machine learning framework name.
The introductory data exploration was created with the help of few notebooks kindly provided by Brendon Hall:
